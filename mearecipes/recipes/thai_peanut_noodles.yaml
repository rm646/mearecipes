    water: 1.5 cup
    cilantro: 2 tbsp

method:
    1: Press the saute button on your Instant Pot. Once it displays hot, add oil and then add the minced garlic and ginger. Saute for a minute until garlic and ginger start changing color.
    2: Add in the veggies - carrots, pepper and green onion and toss to combine. You may reserve some spring onion greens for garnish.
    3: Push veggies to the side and to the center of the pot add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, sriracha, peanut butter and salt.
    4: Whisk to combine the sauce. You may also combine the sauce beforehand in a bowl.
    5: Break spaghetti into half and then add to the pot. Add water until spaghetti is just covered. You may press the noodles slightly with a spatula so that noodles on top get slightly under water.
    6: Close the pot with its lid. Press the manual or pressure cook button and cook on high pressure for 4 minutes. The pressure valve should be in the sealing position. Do a quick pressure release.
    7: Open the pot, use a tong to mix the sauce, noodles and veggies together.
    8: Add reserved green onion greens, juice of 1 lime and cilantro. Serve the noodles with crushed peanuts on top! Adjust sriracha and honey to taste. If you like spicy noodles, add more of sriracha.
