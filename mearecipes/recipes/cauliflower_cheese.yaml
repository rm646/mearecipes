name: Cauliflower cheese
ingredients:
  large cauliflower: 1
  milk: 500 mL
  flour: 4 tbsp
  butter: 50 g
  strong cheddar: 100 g
  breadcrumbs: 3 tbsp
method:
  1: >
      Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, then add 1 large cauliflower,
      broken into pieces, and cook for 5 mins â€“ lift out a piece to test,
      it should be cooked.
  2: >
      Drain the cauliflower, then tip into an ovenproof dish.
      Heat oven to 220C/200C/gas 7.
  3: >
      Put the saucepan back on the heat and add 500ml milk,
      4 tbsp flour and 50g butter.
  4: >
      Keep whisking fast as the butter melts and the mixture comes to the boil â€“
      the flour will disappear and the sauce will begin to thicken.
      Whisk for 2 mins while the sauce bubbles and becomes nice and thick.
  5: >
      Turn off the heat, stir in most of the 100g grated cheddar cheese and pour
      over the cauliflower. Scatter over the remaining cheese,
      and 2-3 tbsp breadcrumbs if using.
  6: >
      Put in the oven and bake for 20 mins until bubbling.
