Description: # mears-recipes
        I had a problem: I wanted to plan meals for the week, then go shopping. But
        working out what I needed to buy given a number of recipes with some overlap
        was tedious.
        
        This program tries to solve that problem by combining the ingredients of
        selected recipes into a shopping list.
        
        View the available recipes with
        ```bash
        $ python mearecipes/main.py list
        ```
        
        See a particular recipe's details with
        ```bash
        $ python mearecipes/main.py show -i <recipe_index>
        ```
        where <recipe_index> is the number from the list printed by the previous
        command.
        
        Select recipes and print the resulting shopping list with
        ```bash
        $ python mearecipes/main.py shop
        ```
