I had a problem: I wanted to plan meals for the week, then go shopping. But
working out what I needed to buy given a number of recipes with some overlap
was tedious.

This program tries to solve that problem by combining the ingredients of
selected recipes into a shopping list.

View the available recipes with
```bash

```
