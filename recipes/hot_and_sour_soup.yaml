name: Hot and Sour Soup
ingredients:
  chicken stock: 8 cup
  shiitake mushrooms: 8 oz
  rice vinegar: 1/4 cup
  soy sauce: 1/4 cup
  ground ginger: 2 tbsp
  chilli: 1 tsp
  garlic: 2
  cornstarch: 1/4 cup
  eggs: 2
  tofu: 1
  spring onions: 4
  oil: 1 tsp
method:
  1: Set aside 1/4 cup of the chicken or vegetable broth for later use.
  2: Add the remaining 7 ¾ cups chicken or vegetable broth, mushrooms, bamboo shoots (if using), rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, ginger and chili garlic sauce to a large stock pot, and stir to combine.  Heat over medium-high heat until the soup reaches a simmer.
  3: While the soup is heating, whisk together the ¼ cup of broth (that you had set aside) and cornstarch in a small bowl until completely smooth.  Once the soup has reached a simmer, stir in the cornstarch mixture and stir for 1 minute or so until the soup has thickened.
  4: Continue stirring the soup in a circular motion, then drizzle in the eggs in a thin stream (while still stirring the soup) to create egg ribbons.  Stir in the tofu, half of the green onions, and sesame oil.  Then season the soup with salt and a pinch* of white pepper (or black pepper) to taste.  If you’d like a more “sour” soup, feel free to add in another tablespoon or two of rice wine vinegar as well.  Or if you’d like a spicier soup, add in more chili garlic sauce.
  5: Serve immediately, garnished with the extra green onions.
