  1: >
      Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, then add 1 large cauliflower,
      broken into pieces, and cook for 5 mins â€“ lift out a piece to test,
      it should be cooked.

      Drain the cauliflower, then tip into an ovenproof dish.
      Heat oven to 220C/200C/gas 7.

      Put the saucepan back on the heat and add 500ml milk,
      4 tbsp flour and 50g butter.

      Keep whisking fast as the butter melts and the mixture comes to the boil â€“

      over the cauliflower. Scatter over the remaining cheese,
      and 2-3 tbsp breadcrumbs if using.
