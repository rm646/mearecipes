name: Lentil Dhal
ingredients:
  oil: 1 tbsp
  onion: 1
  chilli: 1 tsp
  garlic clove: 4
  ginger: 1 tbsp
  garam masala: 2 tsp
  ground cinnamon: 1/2 tsp
  ground turmeric: 2 tsp
  salt: 2 tsp
  water: 3 cup
  dried red lentils: 400 g
  tomato: 3
  can coconut milk: 1
method:
  1: Set the Instant Pot to sauté and add the oil or a few tablespoons of water. Sauté the  onions for 3 to 4 minutes until they are just starting to turn golden, then add the ginger and garlic. Cook for a further 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
  2: Turn off the Instant Pot then add all of the spices and seasonings. Allow them to cook in the residual heat of the pot for about 1 minutes, stirring them constantly.
  3: Add the water to the pot, and using a metal spoon, have a really good scrape into the bottom of the pot all over, to mostly remove the brown bits from the bottom. This step is important because otherwise you could get the "burn" message popping up on your display later.
  4: Next add the lentils, tomatoes and coconut milk and give it all a really good stir. The lentils will likely have clumped up a bit so break them up as you stir.
  5: Put the lid on the Instant Pot, seal the vent and set it to MANUAL (PRESSURE COOK) on newer models, high pressure, for 8 minutes.
  6: Allow the pressure to release naturally. Remove the lid and give it a really good stir then serve.
